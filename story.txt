A bedridden patient captivates a hospitalized girl with a fantastic tale involving heroes, mystics and villains on a desert island

The tale was so absolutely incredible that all other stories after that were completely
ruined. The girl didn't even bother listening to other peoples' stories afther that.
It was completely ruined. She honestly wishes she hadn't heard that story. Thats how
good it was. Nothing will ever compare to it.

This tale was so legendary that after the little girl was cleared to leave the hospital, she 
read many books trying to find something that would compare to it. Alas, she could not find
anything even remotley as amazing. It was then that she decided that she would write a book on this story.
So, thats what she did and now she is a best selling author.

Her book became the best selling novel ever.She earned a lot of money through it.
Ultimately she could not handle her success and became an alcoholic. She went into rehab and was advised to go on a vacation to a desert island. 
She then met a lot of people on her adventure. 
Eventually she realised that the story she was told is unfolding in her own life.
