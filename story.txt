A bedridden patient captivates a hospitalized girl with a fantastic tale involving heroes, mystics and villains on a desert island

The tale was so absolutely incredible that all other stories after that were completely
ruined. The girl didn't even bother listening to other peoples' stories afther that.
It was completely ruined. She honestly wishes she hadn't heard that story. Thats how
good it was. Nothing will ever compare to it.
